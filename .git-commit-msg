fix: add iOS Capacitor fallback for VitalityOrb (Web Worker not supported)

CRITICAL iOS BUG FIX:

Problem:
- Web Worker + OffscreenCanvas not supported in iOS Capacitor WebView
- transferControlToOffscreen() threw InvalidStateError on iOS
- App crashed on startup with blank screen

Root Cause:
- Even though Safari 16.4+ supports OffscreenCanvas, Capacitor's
  WKWebView wrapper does NOT support transferControlToOffscreen()
- Web Worker implementation only works on desktop browsers

Solution - Smart Detection & Graceful Fallback:

1. Detect Capacitor environment:
   const isCapacitor = !!(window as any).Capacitor;

2. Check actual transferControlToOffscreen support:
   typeof (canvas as any).transferControlToOffscreen === 'function'

3. Use Web Worker ONLY on desktop browsers:
   if (supportsOffscreenCanvas && !isCapacitor) {
     // Web Worker path (desktop)
   } else {
     // Main thread path (iOS/Capacitor)
   }

4. Keep TypedArray optimization on both paths:
   - Zero GC even on main thread
   - Float32Array for 900 particles
   - Same performance benefits

Platform Support Matrix:
- Desktop Chrome/Edge: Web Worker ✓
- Desktop Safari 16.4+: Web Worker ✓
- iOS Capacitor: Main Thread (TypedArray) ✓
- Mobile Safari: Main Thread (TypedArray) ✓

Console Logging:
- '[VitalityOrb] Using Web Worker (desktop mode)'
- '[VitalityOrb] Using main thread rendering (iOS/Capacitor mode)'

Benefits:
✓ Works on ALL platforms (desktop + iOS)
✓ Zero GC on both paths (TypedArray)
✓ Optimal performance per platform
✓ Graceful degradation
✓ No more InvalidStateError crashes
